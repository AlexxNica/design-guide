# Syntax Highlighting

Syntax highlighting uses Prism, a lightweight, extensible syntax highlighter, to encourage good author practices. Prism is used to highlight embedded languages (e.g. CSS inside HTML, JavaScript inside HTML), code blocks, and inline code. According to the HTML5 spec, the recommended way to define a code language is a language-xxxx class, which is what Prism uses. 

## Available Classes

Styling can be applied in the following ways:

* include the `prism.css` and `prism.js` 
* `css` `html` `javascript` `sass` - included languages classes
