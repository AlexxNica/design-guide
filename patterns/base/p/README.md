# Paragraph

The p element represents a paragraph. Authors traditionally divide their thoughts and arguments into sequences of paragraphs.

## Available Classes

Styling can be applied in the following ways:

* `.base--p` - class
* `.base--STYLED p` - `<p>` tag inside a class of `.base--STYLED`
* `%base--p` - extended through Sass
