# Helper Apps

These are a handful of helper apps that can be run and will automatically run the appropriate commands, removing the need to know the specific commands for each item. They will only work on OSX machines. They will try to use [iTerm 2](http://iterm2.com/), and if that's not available, they will use Terminal. Each command can also be run on its own in a terminal of choice.

* **Install** - `npm install -g gulp && npm install`
* **Start Server** - `gulp`
