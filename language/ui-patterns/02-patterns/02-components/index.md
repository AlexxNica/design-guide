title: Components
---

Components are [self-contained interface items](http://pointnorth.io/#components) that are used to view and/or interact with content. Components should be adapt to [available features](http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/grade-the-components.html) and [their own size](https://github.com/snugug/eq.js). Navigation and search are examples of components. A combination of elements and components is used to create larger layouts.
