title: Layouts
---

Layouts are a way of arranging components on a page. Layouts are responsible for the sizing and positioning of elements and components on all or part of a page. Headers and footers may be examples of layouts. Layouts should respond to the viewport and should be small enough to cover only what's absolutely necessary for that layout. For example, a layout for an article shouldn't include a page's header or footer layouts; it should just be a layout for an article.
