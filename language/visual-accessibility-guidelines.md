### Accessibility
High color contrast helps users who are partially or completely color-blind see differences between certain colors. It creates a strong visual hierarchy and improved usability for everyone. When choosing colors and contrast ratios for typography it is important to adhere to the IBM Design Language recommendations for accessibility, as we must meet WCAG 2.0 AA requirements. Never rely on color as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.
