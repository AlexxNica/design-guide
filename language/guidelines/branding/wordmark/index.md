The IBM Watson wordmark and logo represents our brand and should be managed carefully. It is typeset in a combination of Helvetica Neue Light and Helvetica Neue Bold to align with IBM standards. When possible, it should be used in all internal and external communications that focus on the IBM Watson brand.

For an app that has been developed by an Ecosystem partner using IBM Watson, and has either launched for commercial release or is in late-stage development, the recommended mark is "Powered by IBM Watsonâ„¢". Use the wordmark within applications on screens specific to IBM Watson capabilities and on application-specific websites or communications that refer to IBM Watson technology.

## Specifications

### Spacing considerations

It is important to include adequate spacing around these elements to avoid visual clutter. Keep the area around the IBM Watson wordmark separated from other visual elements by a distance approximately equal to the height of the IBM Watson wordmark. This distance is considered the minimum uninterrupted space surrounding the mark.

### Color Usage

The wordmark and logo for IBM Watson should only appear in the approved color combinations. Any one of the [three primary colors](color.html) for IBM Watson may be used in combination with black or white for use on light or dark backgrounds, respectively. For dark color palettes, use lighter values of the IBM Watson primary colors.

## Logo versus Avatar

The logo for IBM Watson serves as the visual representation of the brand. The logo may be used as a static element as it pertains to products. The IBM Watson avatar is recommended in situations when Watson is interacting with, aiding, or responding to a user.
