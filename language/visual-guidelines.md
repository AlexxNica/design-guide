## Typography
Typography is the vehicle that delivers content to interfaces. It sets the visual tone for the entire Watson experience. Text is largely differentiated by size and weight, keeping other properties the same or similar, differentiating only when necessary for the sake of clarity.

### Helvetica Neue for IBM
Per IBM Design (link to IBM guidelines on typography): as a rule and wherever possible, use Helvetica Neue. It is the font of science and the information age, with a precision and objectivity that commands respect.  We lean on Helvetica Neue to do the hard work of conveying information, specifications and the basics. Its clean confidence makes it ideal for our product design. IBM Watson recommends choosing no more than 4 font weights per product.
*We are currently in the process of inquiring about full usage rights and licensing for Helvetica Neue for IBM. During this time, we're unable to provide downloadable font assets. Please defer to the Cross-Platform Fontstack Options below for comparable fontstacks.*

### Typographic Scale
IBM Design Language recommends using modular type scales to create harmonious proportions and structure; IBM Watson uses a subset of those scales. Whenever possible, use Major Third or Perfect Forth to establish balance and determine relationships between font sizes.

### Cross-Platform Fontstack Options
Desktop or Browser: font-family: "Helvetica Neue for IBM", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
Apple Watch: font-family: “San Francisco”; (add this? @una)
iOS: font-family: "Helvetica Neue";
Android options: font-family: "Roboto";

## Color
Color is a crucial component of our visual vernacular, helping to unify the look and feel of all communications. The IBM Design core color system comprises a wide spectrum of colors; IBM Watson relies on a defined subset of those colors to establish its unique presence while respecting the broader IBM Design guidelines.

### Choosing Your Color Palette
The IBM Watson color system consists of a set of primary colors and secondary colors, with additional supporting color values. The colors chosen for IBM Watson are flexible and distinguish Watson as a brand across all user experiences. Carefully choose colors that reinforce Watson's personality (link to personality) and set the tone of your product.

Choose a primary color, a secondary color, and an accent color. Use additional color values and neutrals from the IBM Design color palette as needed.

Color is a powerful communication tool to determine hierarchy on a page. Use ample white space and neutrals to create balance and to direct users' attention. Use tints and shades of your primary or secondary colors to unify your design. These values can add variety to your palette without additional colors. It is essential to understand color psychology to evoke desired feelings or moods from users. For example, while warm colors can impress a sense of energy, and cool colors can feel soothing.

Primary: Blue 60, Secondary: Orange 50, Accent: Teal 40  
*When possible, use a neutral value as a background color instead of pure white.*


2. Color hierarchy: Dark Palette

Primary: Blue 30, Secondary: Orange 30, Accent: Teal 30  
*When possible, use a grey value as a background color instead of pure black.*

### Accessibility
When choosing colors and contrast ratios for typography it is important to adhere to the IBM Design Language recommendations for accessibility, as we must meet WCAG 2.0 AA requirements. Never rely on color as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.

## Iconography
The IBM Design Language offers three types of iconography to address a variety of scenarios in which a visual representation is valuable to the user. Each icon will have assigned concepts it represents.

### Building Icons
When designing icons of your own, apply some basic building blocks to achieve harmony.  Use geometric shapes to maintain consistency among various icons.  Just the right amount of padding can ensure icons look similar in different sizes.  Use sharp, technical outlines to evoke a sense of clarity and accuracy.  Finish the icon off with a balancing solid for a sense of stability.
