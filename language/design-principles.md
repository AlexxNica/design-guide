Watson design principles are actionable guidelines that inform the design and development of cognitive software products, in order to provide consistently excellent experiences for users. They are meant to be applied in conjunction with the IBM Design Language best practices and principles. These design principles are explicitly related to Watson, but some principles may not apply to every use case.
