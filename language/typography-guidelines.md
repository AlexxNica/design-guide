## Typography
Typography is the vehicle that delivers content to interfaces. It sets the visual tone for the entire Watson experience. Text is largely differentiated by size and weight, keeping other properties the same or similar, differentiating only when necessary for the sake of clarity.

### Helvetica Neue for IBM
Per IBM Design (link to IBM guidelines on typography): as a rule and wherever possible, use Helvetica Neue. It is the font of science and the information age, with a precision and objectivity that commands respect.  We lean on Helvetica Neue to do the hard work of conveying information, specifications and the basics. Its clean confidence makes it ideal for our product design. IBM Watson recommends choosing no more than 4 font weights per product.

### Typographic Scale
IBM Design Language recommends using modular type scales to create harmonious proportions and structure; IBM Watson uses a subset of those scales. Whenever possible, use Major Third or Perfect Forth to establish balance and determine relationships between font sizes.
